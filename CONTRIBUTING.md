# Contributing Guidelines

## First off

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project 🙏.

## I'm stuck

I'd expect you to be reasonably proficient with JavaScript, Git, and React. If you aren't (for example, you were
lured here by the [first timers only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) issues 😉) it's perfectly fine! I'd love
to help you out. Please understand, though, that I might be a bit busy. But do reach out via Twitter: 
[@xnt](https://twitter.com/xnt).

## I found a bug / have a feature request

At the moment, the project is super tiny. So I'd expect Issues to suffice for both. Go ahead, navigate to 
[Issues](https://github.com/xnt/react-something-nice/issues) and search for a discussion similar to what 
you're thinking about. If you can't find it, by all means, create your own.

I will tag it accordingly and hopefully someone can work on it soon.
